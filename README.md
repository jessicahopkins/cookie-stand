## Salmon Cookies

I'm in the process of building an app to display Home page information and Sales Data for Pat's Salmon Cookies.

Functionality has been added to the Sales page.  There is a working table to display the sales data for each original city that Salmon cookies were sold in.

Updated the Home page to display contact information and store hours for the founding stores.

Additional functionality added on 11/2/23 to add new locations to the table on the sales page. A form was created to collect user input and update the existing table.

Customized fonts and styling added per design specification.

### Reflections and Comments

* Stuck on #5 of Sales Data page.  Unable to get to print output for Seattle.  Was trying to get one city to work and then would complete the other cities.
* Relied heavily on Chat GPT, however, was still unable to complete.  Also, worked with classmate Lana during lab hours to bounce idea's off of.
* Lab 07 - Stuck on creating constructor, unable to finish the lab at this time without support.  ChatGPT wasn't helpful today.  I believe I was able to get the HTML structure for the table started correctly.
* Lab 8b - With the assistance from the code review during class, where we reviewd Brendan's code, and had a sample to go off of, I was able to get the lab functioning and the table made.  I also completed the home page information after getting assistance from a TA.  Thank you Tammy!!!
* Lab 09 - I was able to create the form successfully per the demo provided in class.  I got stuck on creating the event listener and requested assistance from TA when I couldn't get any further via ChatGPT.
