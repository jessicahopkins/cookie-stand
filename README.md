### Reflections and Comments

* Stuck on #5 of Sales Data page.  Unable to get to print output for Seattle.  Was trying to get one city to work and then would complete the other cities.
* Relied heavily on Chat GPT, however, was still unable to complete.  Also, worked with classmate Lana during lab hours to bounce idea's off of.
* Lab 07 - Stuck on creating constructor, unable to finish the lab at this time without support.  ChatGPT wasn't helpful today.  I believe I was able to get the HTML structure for the table started correctly.
